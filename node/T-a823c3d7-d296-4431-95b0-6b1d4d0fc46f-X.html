  <dd class="data-value"><p>For defining routes for ships to normally navigate, pre-planned, dormant, channels, routes and anchorages are surveyed during peacetime. Although they are not routes in the strictest sense, anchorages, in view of their importance to shipping, and for the fact they may be subject to Mine Countermeasures (MCM), are categorised as ‘routes ‘. They should be designed in accordance with geographic features of the area and may therefore be either circular or box shape. Selection of known routes for use by allied shipping during tension or war enables environmental data and prominent sonar contacts on, or near, the routes to be collected in peacetime and compiled by national Mine Warfare Data Centres and inserted into comprehensive Mine Warfare Pilots (AMP-11) for use by MCM forces. ‘Q-Route ‘ is a series of maritime routes that a ship may follow when transiting between the open ocean and port approaches. Channels are normally established to coincide with routes, the centreline of the channel being identical to the line connecting the route positions. Channels will usually be marked by offset buoys (if redundancy is required). The predefined Q-Routes are given in AHP-7. The Maritime Q-Route Management Application provides the users with capabilities to create these routes or importing previously defined Q-Routes.</p>
