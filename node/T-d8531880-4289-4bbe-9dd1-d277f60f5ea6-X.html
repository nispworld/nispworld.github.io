  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Maritime Picture Management Application provides compiling and presenting the information related to both combatant and non-combatant maritime vessels. The functionality builds the Maritime Operational Picture (MOP), in the broadest sense, which consists of all kinds of Maritime Operational Objects available. MOP is the overall collection of the Military Picture (MP)(The collection of all recognised combatant Tracks, Vessels and relevant Reference Objects), White Picture (WP) (The collection of civilian maritime Tracks and Vessels with classification of non-combatants (merchant, fishing, pleasure, research, government etc.) and relevant Reference Objects), and other Information such as UNKNOWN and PENDING tracks, other available supportive information. The NATO Recognised Maritime Picture (RMP) is a managed geographic presentation of processed all-source contact and information data, known at a given time, from all available assets, and compiled by an assigned RMP Manager. The RMP consists of all contacts in the maritime environment, both surface and subsurface, commercial, military and government platforms and vessels. The WP is built first on the NU Domain by using AIS and LRIT data from contracted sources (as well as other NU data and sources) and then the WP information is transferred to NS Domain. The WP is then elaborated more with the information received from NATO assets. The RMP is built on NS Domain as an operational, non-real-time, geographic presentation of recognised surface and subsurface units, forces, and operations. The RMP is one of the components of the NATO Common Operational Picture (NCOP). The Maritime Picture Management Application allows the user to create, query, and retrieve current and historical information of underlying data (e.g. tracks, vessels, figures, ports, special points)comprising the MOP.</p>
