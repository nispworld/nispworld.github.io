  <dd class="data-value"><p>During execution, control of joint fire support forces is normally exercised through the J-3. The J-3 integrates and synchronizes fires with other major elements of the operation such as maneuver, information-related activities, special operations, and logistics. The Joint Fires Element (JFE) manages the daily joint fire support coordination responsibilities. Since the JFE is composed of representatives from operations, plans, targeting, intelligence, and each subordinate and supporting command, it can be a powerful coordination and synchronization tool for the J-3. The JFE performs the tasks outlined by the J-3. The JFE may assess joint fires and joint fire support operations, providing rapid feedback to the JFC for decision making. Joint fire support execution requires operational battle tracking of friendly forces and equipment, targets, and threats to friendly forces. This is especially important as joint fires are coordinated across components (Service or functional) and between or within operational areas. Joint fires require planning, coordination, and synchronization to maximize effectiveness and minimize risks to friendly forces. The JFE can assist the J-3 with implementing measures to reduce the risk of friendly fire incidents, to include disciplined execution of OPORDs, ACOs, ATOs, SPINS, targeting guidance, deconfliction, ROE, CID, and PID procedures and maintain the detailed SA necessary to synchronize the joint fire support system.</p>
