  <dd class="data-value"><p>Search-and-Rescue (SAR) is the use of aircraft, surface craft, submarines, specialized rescue teams and equipment to search for and rescue personnel in distress on land or at sea. The operational aspects are discharged by nations with each nation responsible for SAR within an area, or a number of areas. In times of peace, SAR procedures remain a national responsibility. In time of conflict, or for a specific NATO operation, the existing SAR organization would continue to be used, whenever possible. However, NATO commanders are responsible for the planning and conduct of local SAR for forces under their command. Such SAR operations would be conducted in conjunction with local rescue coordination centres in accordance with doctrinal guidance contained in ATP-10, Search and Rescue. NATO has no responsibility in maintaining parallel SAR organization to that of IMO or Nations. Commanders of NATO naval forces are also charged with maintaining SAR plans for their forces. Such plans are to provide, both in peace and war, for appropriate liaison with national SAR authorities and NATO Major Subordinate Commander in order to provide mutual assistance in SAR operations [ATP-10]. Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) Missions are defined in ATP-62. The Maritime SAR Application provides the user to generate Tasking Order (OPTASK SAR) to execute SAR within a Maritime Operation.</p>
