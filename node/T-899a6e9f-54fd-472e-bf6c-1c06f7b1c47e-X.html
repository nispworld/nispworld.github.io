  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Dynamic and Time-Sensitive Targeting (TST) Application enables users to develop and manage targeting information in order to provide coherent information sharing about time-sensitive targets and TST activities. The application also enables users to manage cross-boundary issues and to manage multi-component or joint force assets to find, fix, track, target, engage and assess the targets. Moreover the application enables users to prioritise, categorize, coordinate, de-conflict these targets, and to support engagement by the joint force. Time-sensitive targets (TSTs) are those targets requiring immediate response because they pose (or will soon pose) a danger to friendly operations, or are highly lucrative, fleeting targets of opportunity. These targets are designated as such by the JFC because their engagement is of a high enough priority to warrant immediate action in order to support campaign objectives. Some examples of potential TSTs could include  Mobile rocket launchers (MRLs); Mobile high threat surface-to-air missile systems (SAMs); Mobile C2 vehicles and facilities; Naval vessels, military or civilian which pose a threat and demand an immediate action to neutralize; Loaded transporter, erector, launchers (TELs); Deployed theatre ballistic missiles (TBMs); Weaponized WMD assets; Previously unidentified C2 nodes; Fixed targets; Terrorist leadership; Mobile radio/TV broadcast stations.</p>
