  <dd class="data-value"><p>The NATO Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Policy for NATO Standards and NATO Dispositions Related to the Issues of Copyrights for NATO Standards has been established by the NATO Committee for Standardization (NCS), taking account of the Charter of the NATO Standardization Organization and the NATO Framework Document on Civil Standards. NATO standardization documents of various kinds shall be based on solutions that best meet the full range of tasks and objectives of NATO defined by the NATO Policy for Standardization, the NATO Policy for Interoperability, and other relevant documents including the North Atlantic Treaty. In order to further support the interoperability of resources within the full range of NATO’s tasks, it is important to reduce the risk to its standardization community, that investment in the preparation, adoption and application of NATO standardization documents is wasted as the result of an Essential IPR3 being unavailable to parties seeking to use the NATO standardization document. To meet this objective, it is desirable to reach an agreement of mutual benefit to meet the needs of NATO and the holders of IPRs. IPR holders should be adequately and fairly rewarded for the use of essential protected material or proprietary material. Measures will be implemented, to the greatest extent possible, to ensure that all activities related to the preparation, adoption and application of NATO standardization documents, enable NATO standardization documents to be available to potential users in accordance with the general principles of standardization and NATO overall security rules.</p>
