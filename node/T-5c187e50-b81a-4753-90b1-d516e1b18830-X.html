  <dd class="data-value">The &ldquo;Operate&rdquo; business process area is composed of a collection of processes for the conduct of planning, preparing and executing command and control (C2) for military operations in all operational domains and for all military functions. From a cognitive perspective, command and control can be grouped into inter-connected and synchronized interlocking phases. * Collecting &ndash; to manage the collection of sensing data followed by processing to support situational awareness and decision making. * Decision Making &ndash; to build awareness, anticipate threats, assess risks and options, and make effective decisions. * Effecting &ndash; to exploit all military instruments of power to deliver effects and achieve execution superiority, and assess the effectiveness and consequences. * Connecting &ndash; to link and harmonize the above three phases through communication and information capabilities. These phases are reflected in the organizational business processes in the Operate area, using doctrinally established naming conventions and process decompositions. The processes are not discrete; they overlap and recur as circumstances demand. Planning starts an iteration of the operations process. Upon completion of the initial order, planning continues as leaders revise the plan based on changing circumstances. Preparing begins during planning and continues through execution. Execution puts a plan into action by applying military forces to achieve an operational effect. Assessing is continuous, supported by [[Analytical Support Processes]], and influences the other three activities. Domain and function specific sub-processes define specializations of the common business process.</dd>
