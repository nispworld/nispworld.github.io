  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Operational Readiness Evaluation or OPEVAL process is a critical examination and certification of the readiness and operational capabilities of a force package, unit, headquarters or any portion thereof. The process is performed by an independent organization and validates that the entity under evaluation meets the required standards and criteria in areas such as Availability, Flexibility, Employability and Deployability, Readiness, Connectivity, Sustainability, Survivability, Medical Force Protection, and Interoperability. The process also identifies  * Under what conditions the entity under evaluation is capable of accomplishing its objectives. * The factors limiting the entity under evaluationâ€™s level of performance. Operational Readiness Evaluation is a multi-level, iterative process  units are individually certified before they are combined into and evaluated as an interoperable force package. For example, individual Forward Air Controllers may have to be certified according to the criteria set out in STANAG 3797, and whilst a package of tactical land forces will be evaluated against the respective doctrinal standards such as ATP-35. Interoperability is the ability to act together coherently, effectively, and efficiently, to achieve common objectives; interoperability criteria are therefore defined through standardized concepts, doctrine, tactics, procedures, equipment, language and information. The synchronization of this multi-level, iterative process is directed and controlled through the Evaluation Programme Management process. Typical military evaluation programmes consist of a Joint Evaluation Programme for Joint HQs and Joint Assets, and domain and functional specific Programmes (air, land, maritime, cyber, SOF etc.) The Operational Readiness Evaluation process is divided into the following sub-processes</p>
