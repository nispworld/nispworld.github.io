  <dd class="data-value"><p>Execution is putting a plan into action by applying military forces to accomplish the mission and adjusting the plan based on changing circumstances. During execution, commanders, staffs, and subordinate commanders focus their efforts on translating decisions into actions. Friction and uncertainty, especially enemy actions, dynamically affect plans. During operations execution, the commander aims to achieve efficiency, effectiveness and synergy of the force components conducting tactical actions to create the intended effects as described in the operations design. This is achieved through operations management and through this, the joint force will  * Employ assigned capabilities according to the operation plan to accomplish the mission; * Assess the effect of each action in terms of the progress towards achieving the objectives, including any risk, and the resources required for its success; * Exploit a favourable situation, or mitigate an unfavourable one, by adjusting or developing plans; and * Revise the operational assessments at regular intervals, unless dictated by a significant change in the operational situation or when operations assessment necessitates a change. The decision cycle is a method that depicts how command and staff elements during execution of an operation determine required actions, codify them in directives and orders, execute them, and monitor their results. The decision cycle has four phases  Monitor, Assess, Plan and Direct.</p>
