  <dd class="data-value"><p>Transition activities comprise the progressive transfer of functions, supporting institutions, infrastructures and responsibilities between actors to reach an enduring level of capability for the host affiliate so that it is not dependent on a significant operational military contribution. The aim is to transition all the functions performed by the joint force in an orderly fashion. Some functions may develop into activities conducted by a combination of the alliance and local government and security as transition advances. Once all transitions are complete, the alliance force can depart or remain, but under a new or revised mandate. The transition process is part of a longer-term reform and transformation process that will be managed by other actors. The alliance should be prepared to provide security capabilities until they can be relieved by local forces or other actors. Transitions are negotiated processes with the host affiliate and other actors. This makes them non-linear and dependent on host affiliate political processes and interests, which may change over time. Flexibility is vital, requiring those planning transition activities to identify the range and limits of acceptable outcomes and to work within those limits to develop the transition plan. Transition activities are likely to take place in a multilateral, inter-agency setting, with the alliance being one of several actors involved. The ability of any single actor to manage transition activities as a whole, or to define its outcomes, will be limited. Therefore, no one actor will have the freedom to plan and execute transition activities alone.</p>
