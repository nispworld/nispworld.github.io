  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Medical Support Simulation Processes describe all activities to support planning for operations with medical support simulation. Operations include  *Specific operations under consideration, in planning or underway (“the mission). This is the domain of strategic and operational level planning staff. *Training exercises (“the training mission). This is the domain of strategic and operational level planning staff. *Operations which may occur in the future (“a mission). This is within the realms of contingency planning and the NATO defence planning process. NATO planning is conducted at all levels, i.e. from the North Atlantic Council down to the operational level, including consultations at the tactical level. The Comprehensive Operations Planning Directive (see [ACO COPD, 2013]) describes the military aspects of operations planning as the responsibility of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe. He is responsible for developing Military Response Options (MROs), delivering the strategic Concept of Operations (CONOPS) and the strategic-level Operations Plan (OPLAN). Appropriate CONOPS and OPLANs are also developed at the operational level and below and the operational-level contributes towards the development of many of the strategic-level planning products, including the Combined Joint Statement of Requirements which is the vehicle for determining which forces will be required to deploy in support of the mission. It is developed iteratively with the CONOPS and OPLAN. Together these planning products address the availability and capability of facilities and resources which may be available to the mission commander. In the medical domain these include the availability and quality of host nation logistic infrastructure, facilities and related medical capabilities, options for contracting the support of third parties and the availability of military medical capability. While the early phases of planning emphasises the gathering of available information, later planning phases begin to address the required mix of forces and capabilities to meet the operational requirement. At this point a wide range of factors are examined as part of a detailed mission analysis and theatre requirements begin to take shape. It is during the development of feasible MROs and the detailed analysis of the selected MRO when the MSSC is likely to be of greatest use. It will allow for an assessment of relevant factors, gathered and developed during the operational-level Phase 2’ to contribute directly the mission analysis in the operational-level Phase 3a’. The MSSC’s utility may also extend into the development of courses of action and the data generated may contribute directly to the production of the CONOPS.</p>
