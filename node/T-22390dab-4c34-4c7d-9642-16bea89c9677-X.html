  <dd class="data-value"><p>Defeat the device (DtD) is a joint activity aiming at detecting, neutralizing and mitigating IEDs and IED events’ effects. DtD within the C-IED approach describes a reactive as well as proactive pillar of operational and tactical activities aimed at improving host nation (HN) and Allied force protection (FP), freedom of action and security. DtD aims to deliver freedom to manoeuvre, and to contribute to stabilisation by protecting the population and providing physical security. DtD also relies heavily upon understanding and intelligence. This activity considers the implications of devices and explores the objectives (ends), actions (ways) and enablers (means) to defeat them. Adversaries who deploy IEDs are, as a rule, highly adaptive. This requires Alliance activity within DtD to be both flexible and agile in anticipation of the adversary’s intentions. It is supported by a technology and science focus to deliver capability and uses friendly force TTP to mitigate IED effects. Although technology is an area where the Alliance will normally have superiority, it must not be reliant upon technology alone to secure an advantage and defeat the device. DtD is a joint activity carried out across the spectrum of operations that can also have an interagency aspect, by incorporating technical issues with other actors in or out of the JOA. One of its main instruments is the EOD / improvised explosive device defeat (IEDD) capacity, which is integral to a joint force. The commander must define priorities for DtD. A balance needs to be struck between the need to secure mobility and freedom of action at tactical and operational levels and the need to conduct exploitation in support of attack the networks (AtN) efforts. The priorities can change depending on several factors such as the mission and the adversary TTP.</p>
