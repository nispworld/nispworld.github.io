  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Land Operations Assessment Applications enable users to support commanders and staffs continuous monitoring and evaluation of the current situation and the progress of an operation. The application supports the continuous analysis of the operational environment to help commanders and their staffs understand the current situation and its evolution during operations. Functionality is provided to support commanders and staffs evaluate relevant information to develop measures of effectiveness and measures of performance to assess how operations are progressing toward achieving objectives and the desired end state. The application provides support to the differing focus of assessment during planning, preparation, and execution. During planning, the application supports development of the assessment plan that describes measurable tasks, objectives, end state conditions, and associated criterion to assist with assessing progress. During preparation and execution, the application supports structured monitoring of the current situation and enables evaluation of the operation’s progress toward stated objectives and end state conditions by supporting maintenance and update of staff running estimates.</p>
