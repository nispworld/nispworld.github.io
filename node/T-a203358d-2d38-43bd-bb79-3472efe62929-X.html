  <dd class="data-value"><p>Incident Response. Incident response includes measures to neutralize, isolate, contain, and resolve a specific threat or act. The objectives of incident response are to stop the incident and to minimize its effects on mission success, to limit the number of casualties, to facilitate recovery, and to take necessary measures in order to regain operational capability as soon as possible. Effective incident response may require the coordination of the activities of a number of disciplines including, but not limited to, security, safety, firefighting, search and rescue, PA, EOD, and CBRN. Response actions should follow process and procedures outlined in response plans. Incident response includes  (1) Immediate action by first responders, such as quick reaction forces, security forces, fire departments, medical personnel, or hazardous material teams. (2) Establishing an emergency operations centre. (3) Implementing measures to contain, isolate, alleviate, or terminate the incident and alert higher HQ and adjoining units. (4) Implementing operational continuity and alert plans. (5) Implementing additional protective measures. (6) Gathering information, assessing damage, and preserving evidence for prosecution. (7) Releasing internal and external information updates. (8) Coordinating information activities through Info Ops to degrade adversary’s ability to exploit successful attack, to demonstrate HN’s response, and to reassure audiences of NATO’s commitment to their protection. (9) Implementing medical measures commensurate with the major incident medical management and support approach. This includes medical and casualty evacuation procedures. Recovery operations involve the coordination and implementation of measures intended to mitigate the damage, loss, hardship, and suffering caused by a natural, accidental, or deliberate threat event. Recovery operations include measures, tasks, and activities to restore essential capability, protect health, and provide safety and emergency relief. Effective recovery operations may require the coordination of the activities of a number of disciplines including, but not limited to, military engineering, security, EOD, medical, logistics, safety, decontamination, transportation, communications, and PA. In addition, recovery may be facilitated by pre-positioned stores or mitigation materials within the installation. Recovery operations include all necessary steps to restore a maximum operational capability after an incident has been contained.</p>
