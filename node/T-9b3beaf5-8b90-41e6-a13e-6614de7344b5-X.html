      <td>The ASC Develop Airspace Control Plan Process describes the steps to establish alliance agreed procedures for airspace control within the designated airspace control area. The Airspace Control Plan(ACP) directly supports the achievement of campaign or Operational Plan (OPLAN) objectives. The ACP outlines command and control arrangements between the Air Control Authority (ACA), the Air Defence Commander (ADC), component commands, fire support agencies, and civil Air Traffic Control (ATC) along with the procedures for coordinating and deconflicting airspace requirements. An ACP should be responsive to operational developments. Preconditions  1. The Airspace Control Authority (ACA) has been designated. 2.The Joint Airspace Control Cell (JACC) has been established to coordinate and manage the use of airspace.The JACC includes representatives/liaisons from all relevant components and agencies. 3. Airspace data and operational plans are available in machine readable formats to include  [[Airspace Control Means (ACM)</td>
      <td>Airspace Control Means]] (ACM) libraries including Fire Support Coordination Measures (FSCM), control and coordinating measures reported in the Control/Coordination Line Report, Civil Airspace, Operational Plan (OPLAN), Air Defence Plan (ADP), Enemy Courses of Action (COA), Rules of Engagement (ROE), IFF/SIF instructions, Orders of Battle (ORBAT) for Air, Land and Maritime, 4. Automated tools such as chat, word processing and specific automated Airspace Control tools are available to permit coordination of airspace and prepare components of the ACP. Basic Flow of Events  1. The JACC reviews enemy courses of action, OPLANs, ADP and military/ civil ATC resources to determine an overview of airspace usage requirements. 2. The JACC requests textual and grahical displays of military and civilian airspaces and control and coordination measures by a variety of criteria to include  source, area, time, type. 3.The JACC will define the boundaries of the Airspace Control (ASC) area for which the ACP applies. 4. The JACC coordinates service requirements with service components liaisons. 5. The JACC coordinates Air Ground Surveillance (AGS) Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) utilization of airspace for AGS operations. 6. The JACC coordinates Host Nation concerns and requirements with Host Nation liaison. 7. The JACC coordinates how military ATC resources are to be employed and integrated into existing civil ATC systems 8. The JACC coordinates how AD units will interface with civil ATC systems 9. The JACC determines how the ROE will effect airspace control and air defence. 10. The JACC determines IFF/SIF procedures and any other combat ID procedures. 11. The JACC determines geo-reference datum standards, units of measurement, grid reference for the AOR/JOA. 12. The JACC compiles the initial draft of the ACP for the ACA. Post Conditions  1. ACP components have been prepared for initial ACP draft generation.</td>
