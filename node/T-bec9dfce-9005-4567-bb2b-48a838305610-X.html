  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Electronic Treatment Records (ETR) Management Process describes the activities to securely transfer ETRs between national ETR capabilities, primarily in NATO operations, in order to support the provision of the best possible patient care, while protecting patient privacy. In order to support the treatment of patients, and in order to support the planning of the evacuation of patients, medical care providers require access to the ETRs of those patients. If patients are being treated at a Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) that is led by their home nation, it is assumed that the medical care providers at that facility have “direct access to the ETRs of those patients (through the national ETR capability), and such use case is out of scope for the capability described in this UOR document. However, if the patients are being treated at an MTF that is not led by their home nation, there is a need to transfer the ETRs of those patients between the ETR capability of their home nation and the ETR capability available to the medical care providers at the MTF. The transfer of ETRs is between national ETR capabilities. This transfer must happen securely and according to NATO’s requirements described in [NC3A RD-3140, 2011]. These requirements impose the use of attribute based access control.</p>
