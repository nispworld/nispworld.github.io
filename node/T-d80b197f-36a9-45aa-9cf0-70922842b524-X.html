  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Medical Capability Management Processes describe all activities to use the Medical Capability Directory (MCD) and provide an accessible directory that nations can utilize to catalogue their medical capabilities that are likely to be employed within a NATO environment, and to review the medical capabilities of other nations. The â€œcore MCD process is as follows  *The administrators of the MCD (e.g. ACO) set the definitions of the medical capabilities. *Nations catalogue their medical capabilities, i.e. those medical capabilities that are likely to be employed within a NATO environment. Each nation has a reviewer who will approve the medical capabilities that have been catalogued. *An appointed lead nation for an MMU, ACO or another command, will (initially) plan operations (i.e. MMUs) using the approved catalogued medical capabilities. *The lead nation for an MMU, ACO or another command, will export the initially planned operations or the (raw) catalogued medical capabilities, in order to be used in the further medical support planning process. Furthermore, at all times  *The administrators of the MCD ensure that the definitions of the medical capabilities are kept up to date. *Nations ensure that their catalogued medical capabilities are kept up-to-date. *Nations, ACO and other commands (can) read and query the catalogued medical capabilities of all the nations. *The administrators (can) retrieve logon statistics and logs on any changes made to medical capability data.</p>
