  <dd class="data-value"><p>Battlespace management processes describes the necessary adaptive means and measures and procedures that enable the dynamic synchronization of activities in the battlespace. Battlespace management combines and integrates the elements of a joint force to accomplish the commander’s intent and mission; it is thus a key enabler to the success of joint operations. Integrating force elements through battlespace management procedures enables coordination and synchronization according to the commander’s priorities. Battlespace management is not an end in itself, but a process that facilitates and seeks to maximize operational effectiveness and minimize constraints and can contribute to reducing the risk of fratricide. Battlespace management should involve all components and all national contingents operating in the joint operations area (JOA). Efforts should be made to include non-military actors, where relationships allow. This process includes actors from host nations, international organizations (IOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and other governmental departments. Commanders should try to achieve at least unity of purpose with other such actors, even if they lack unity of command. Battlespace management applies at all levels of operations. While different means and measures are relevant at the different levels, all activities require a degree of integration, coordination, synchronization and prioritization. Strategic battlespace management considerations include diplomatic agreements for access and overflight. At the operational level, battlespace management focuses on issues such as competing demands for host-nation support. At the tactical level, boundaries may be drawn between areas of operation to integrate different force elements.</p>
