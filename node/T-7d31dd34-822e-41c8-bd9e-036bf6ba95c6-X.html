  <dd class="data-value"><p>Risk decisions are commanders’ responsibility. The commander at the highest level (i.e. at Strategic Command (SC) or Joint Force Command) usually makes an initial risk response decision, implements overarching FP measures, tasks, and activities, and establishes commander’s guidance concerning willingness to accept risk; subordinate commanders subsequently do the same for their individual forces. Those measures, tasks, and activities that provide protection to the entire force are generally the responsibility of the SC or highest level JFC; others will be the responsibility of the appropriate subordinate JFC, component commanders, or other delegated subordinate commanders. During this step, FP measures, tasks, and activities are developed and analysed as hazards are re-assessed to determine any residual risk. This analysis compares proposed controls or measures with the amount of risk reduction achieved. Risk decisions are always based on the residual risk. This analysis continues until an acceptable level of risk is achieved or until all risks are reduced to a level where benefits outweigh the potential cost. Once developed, the FP measures, tasks, and activities are implemented and can be integrated into SOPs, written and verbal orders, mission briefings, and staff estimates. This is usually achieved by converting FP controls into clear and simple execution orders, establishing proper authorities and accountabilities, and providing the necessary support to implement, whilst remaining fully aware of any residual risk. FP measures, tasks, and activities generally fall into the categories described below.</p>
