  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Office Automation Applications enable users to more effectively support, streamline, control and even automate office activities normally undertaken by individual users. The capabilities they support include generic business operations to collect, create or generate information, to organise, store and protect information, to retrieve, access, use, modify and disseminate information and to support its disposition and final destruction. Office Automation Applications typically provide tailored User Interfaces specific to the type of information being created or manipulated and the office activities being undertaken. Such information types include documents, presentations, spreadsheets, projects, audio, video, still imagery and other standard information/data formats. Master data types include but may not be limited to Customer, Project and Workflow/Task records. Functionality to access and provision information and to automate processes may be limited or enhanced depending upon the Technical Services delivering them, the User Equipment supporting them and the User Profiles (metadata) of consumers accessing them. Office Automation Applications should provide seamlessly integrated, consolidated, coherent and interoperable services and functionality, whilst maintaining assurance of and management of information and knowledge development; ensuring users are better able to produce information products as quickly as possible, with the least amount of human effort and of acceptable quality and assurance. To this end, they must also be integrated with other Information and Knowledge Management applications and services, in order to ensure that they support the NATO Information Lifecycle.</p>
