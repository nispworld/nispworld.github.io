  <dd class="data-value"><p>The purpose of Phase 3a - Operational Estimate - Mission Analysis is to understand the problem, the operational environment and the mission. Mission analysis consists of an in-depth analysis of the crisis situation to determine the operational problem that must be solved and the operational conditions that must be established. It identifies the key operational factors that will influence the achievement of those conditions, and any limitations on the Commander’s freedom of action for the development of an overall operational design. The main outcome of Phase 3a is the Commander’s initial operational design, with the Commander’s planning guidance, and the Operational Planning Guidance (OPG) to formally trigger the Mission Analysis at the component level. ‘Preconditions  ‘ Receipt of the SPD. This is created by SACEUR and identifies the selected MRO based on the NAC Initiating Directive and MC advice received from the political level. ‘Basic Flow  ‘ Following activities can be done from a medical perspective  *Initiate mission analysis  preparation and deployment of medical staff in OLRT (COPD Chapter 4.24.f) *Understand the operational environment and the main actors  on health and medical situation (COPD Chapter 4.25.c) *Contribute to the analysis of the mission (if required)  seek answers to  what conditions must be established, what effects are required, what are the operational actions, What are the operational implications of time, space, forces/actors, what capabilities, support and preconditions for success, what limitations, what are the (plausible) assumptions, what are the outline requirements for civilian-military interaction, what operational risks (COPD Chapter 4.26.a) *Identify and analyse factors (medical)  develop factor/deduction/conclusion tables (COPD Chapter 4.26.c) *Determine key factors (COPD Chapter 4.26.e) *Contribute to the Centres of Gravity analysis (COPD Chapter 4.26.f) *Appreciate limitations on operational freedom of action (COPD Chapter 4.26.g) *Determine assumptions (COPD Chapter 4.26.h) *Determine critical operational requirements  information and knowledge requirements, critical operational support &amp; resource requirements, preconditions for success, requirements for interaction with international and national actors, strategic communication and information strategic requirements, CRM (COPD Chapter 4.26.i) *Contribute to the operational risks (COPD Chapter 4.26.j) *Contribute to and review the Operational Design (COPD Chapter 4.27) *Estimate initial force/capability and C2 requirements - contribute to troops-to-actions analysis (COPD Chapter 4.28) *Review critical operational requirements and CRMs (COPD Chapter 4.29) *Contribute to Mission Analysis Brief (MAB) (COPD Chapter 4.30) *Contribute to issuing of OPG (includes many of the above mentioned items) ‘Post-conditions  ‘ *Operational warning order has been released to components and supporting commands (if necessary). *The operational mission, including objectives, is understood, and any recommendations for change are successfully staffed to SACEUR. *The Commander releases an initial operational design and Commander’s Planning Guidance (CPG) to guide development of COAs. *The Commander releases an OPG to provide guidance to subordinate and supporting commands to assist their planning.</p>
