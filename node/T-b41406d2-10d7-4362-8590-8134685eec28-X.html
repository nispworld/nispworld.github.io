  <dd class="data-value">The terms “contract management” and “contract administration” are often used synonymously. However, “contract management” is commonly understood as a broader and more strategic concept that covers the whole Procurement Cycle including planning, formation, execution, administration and close out of a contract and goes beyond the day to day “administrative” activities in the Procurement Cycle. Contract Management is the ongoing monitoring and management of the vendor’s performance and obligations regarding the promised goods, services or works as well as all other terms and conditions of the contract, such as price and discounts. It includes managing the relationship between the vendor, Procurement Service and the Control and Accounting Section, feedback to the vendor regarding its performance as well as dispute resolution, if necessary. Contract Management is an element in the Procurement Process to ensure that Best Value for Money will be achieved throughout the Procurement Process. Contract Management includes vendor performance evaluation and rating on timely delivery, quality and assistance to the requisitioner. Contract Management is a shared responsibility between the requisitioner and/or end-user and the Procurement Service. The Procurement Service, in cooperation with the requisitioner and/or end-user shall ensure that adequate vendor performance evaluation is conducted. If the requisitioner and/or end-user are not able to resolve a dispute, they shall inform the Procurement Service, in cooperation with the Office of the Legal Adviser, if appropriate, who shall be included in the process.</dd>
