  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Advanced Mode Simulation Run Process describes the activities to define the locations of Medical Treatment Facilities, Medical Evacuation Assets as well as Transportation Networks. Advanced mode will simulate the treatment and evacuation of casualties and will generate an Advanced Report. ‘Preconditions  ‘ A Casualty Stream has been generated, including points of injuries for casualties. Casualty Profiles have been defined. If generic Medical Treatment Facilities are required, these must have been defined. If generic Medical Evacuation Assets are required, these must have been defined. ‘Basic Flow  ‘ 1. Select advanced mode 2. Select generic Medical Treatment Facilities or create or import (actual) Medical Treatment Facilities 3. Assign locations to Medical Treatment Facilities (this may be done by dragging and dropping onto a map) 4. Select generic Medical Evacuation Assets or create or import (actual) Medical Evacuation Assets 5. Assign locations to Medical Evacuation Assets (this may be done by dragging and dropping onto a map) 6. Create or import Transportation Networks 7. Run simulation in advanced mode. (either in fast running mode or slow/visual running mode) ‘Alternative Flows  ‘ Steps 2 and 3 may be executed at any moment after step 1 and before step 7. Steps 4 and 5 may be executed at any moment after step 1 and before step 7. Step 6 may be executed at any moment after step 1 and before step 7. ‘Post-conditions  ‘ The treatment and evacuation of casualties has been simulated and an Advanced Report has been generated. ‘Assumptions  ‘ Casualty profiles are available, including the types of injuries and diseases (that are to be simulated), treatment profiles for each injury and disease and prevalence data. Deriving such prevalence data may require the availability of the following MEDICS capabilities  *MEDICS Trauma Registry capability. *MEDICS Disease Surveillance (System) capability. *MEDICS EPI-NATO capability. *MEDICS Medical Reporting capability. The definitions of generic’ medical capabilities are available and/or information on actual medical capabilities is available, e.g. MTFs and medical evacuation assets, defining the capability and capacity of such capabilities. Transportation network information is available (if needed).</p>
