  <dd class="data-value"><p>ICT Service Operation includes the following main processes (see ITIL)  * Event Management Process  To make sure CIs and services are constantly monitored, and to filter and categorize Events in order to decide on appropriate actions. * Incident Management Process  To manage the lifecycle of all Incidents. The primary objective of Incident Management is to return the IT service to users as quickly as possible. * Request Fulfilment Process  To fulfill Service Requests, which in most cases are minor (standard) Changes (e.g. requests to change a password) or requests for information. * Access Management Process  To grant authorized users the right to use a service, while preventing access to non-authorized users. The Access Management processes essentially execute policies defined in Information Security Management. Access Management is sometimes also referred to as Rights Management or Identity Management. * Problem Management Process  To manage the lifecycle of all Problems. The primary objectives of Problem Management are to prevent Incidents from happening, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Proactive Problem Management analyzes Incident Records, and uses data collected by other IT Service Management processes to identify trends or significant Problems. * IT Operations Control Process  To monitor and control the IT services and their underlying infrastructure. The process IT Operations Control executes day-to-day routine tasks related to the operation of infrastructure components and applications. This includes job scheduling, backup and restore activities, print and output management, and routine maintenance. * Facilities Management Process  To manage the physical environment where the IT infrastructure is located. Facilities Management includes all aspects of managing the physical environment, for example power and cooling, building access management, and environmental monitoring. * Application Management Process  Application Management is responsible for managing applications throughout their lifecycle. * Technical Management Process  Technical Management provides technical expertise and support for the management of the IT infrastructure.</p>
