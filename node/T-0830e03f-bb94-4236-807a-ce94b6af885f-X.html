  <dd class="data-value"><p>Standard maritime shipping routes provide users important context for Maritime Information Management. A route can be defined as the representation of the typical path between two points. A Route Network is an information layer providing a synthetic representation of historical vessel traffic. The ability to display a Shipping Route Network provides Pattern of Life context to users to and helps users distinguish between standard maritime traffic and possible anomalous vessel activities. A Shipping Route Network can be visualized as a number of poly-lines (lines between a series of waypoints) which provide a representation for typical vessel movements along each route. Shipping Route Networks can represent traffic flows from a global, regional or local perspective. Regionally and locally, Shipping Route Networks may also have a seasonal component. It is therefore possible to have multiple Shipping Route Networks representing standard routes for a specific area, region, or any other Area of Operation. The Shipping Routes Network Application maintains a list of Shipping Route Networks where each Route Network will have summary information which further describes the characteristics of vessels using that route in summary statistics. The Shipping Routes Network Application allows the authorised user to perform statistical analysis of the followed routes at sea during a defined period (typically several years) in a defined area in order to check the validity of the current Maritime Shipping Route Network and highlight the necessity to create a new maritime Shipping Route Network.</p>
