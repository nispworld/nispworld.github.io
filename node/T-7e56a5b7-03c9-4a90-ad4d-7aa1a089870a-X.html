  <dd class="data-value"><p>The purpose is to maintain situational awareness of the alliance’s strategic spaces as a baseline for more detailed planning work which will follow political decision-making. A range of experts are consulted to provide their domain knowledge and understanding. A variety of information sources are accessed (from open-source to intelligence material) and relevant information captured for future use. In common with other functions the main output is to contribute to the Commanders’ understanding of developing crises. The information collected during this phase will serve as the baseline for future planning. The Strategic MILENG Planner will submit Requests for Information (RFIs) when information is unknown and continue to update the baseline data as new information becomes available. Information is shared widely between the political, strategic and operational level planning teams of the NATO Command Structure (NCS), and throughout the NATO Force Structure (NFS) as required. In essence this process informs the crisis identification process, building understanding and developing information and inter-personal networks. In practice this is a continuous process. While the planning for a specific operation proceeds through phases 2-6, Phase 1 will continue across the alliance’s strategic spaces. MILENG will continue to develop Capability Packages (CPs) with ACT and supporting Agencies.</p>
