  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Directive on the Handling of Records During the Closure of a NATO Civil or Military Body provides the principles and requirements for the handling of the records of a NATO body in the event of its closure due to a cessation of its functions or its merger with other NATO civilian or military body. This Directive includes guidelines for making disposition decisions regarding which records to transfer to a successor body or to the NATO Archives, and which records to destroy. It will also provide procedures for transferring records to a successor body or the NATO Archives. This Directive is guided by the following principles  * Records identified as essential for current and future business requirements (both active and semi-active records) shall be transferred to the successor body. In the case where here is no designated successor body, these records shall be transferred to the responsible headquarters in the NATO Command structure or to the appropriate office or service or agency at NATO that is responsible for the respective business activity. * Records of permanent value that are no longer required for current and future business (inactive records) shall be transferred to the NATO Archives. * Transfer of records includes change of custodianship. * Records of temporary value that no longer meet current business requirements shall be destroyed in accordance with the NATO Policy on Retention and Disposition and the associated retention schedules, and with due regard to NATO Security Policy. This Directive supports the NATO Information Management Policy (NIMP) and the Primary Directive on Information Management (PDIM), which describe all aspects of information management at a high level.</p>
