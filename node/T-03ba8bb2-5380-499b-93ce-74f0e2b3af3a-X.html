  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Human Response Estimation Process provides “injury profiles that are used to describe the progression of injury severity levels over time taking the dose/dosage/insult values from previous phase as an input. These severity levels in turn are used to determine whether and when an individual is declared a casualty. According to the methodology described in [NATO AMedP-8(C), 2011] if an individual is considered a casualty at the time an injury due to a causative agent or effect first exhibits a specified “injury severity level . For all agents and effects, the input to the human response component is the dose/dosage/insult calculated in the previous phase. Given this estimated dose/dosage/insult, the type and severity of an individual’s injury (i.e., the human response) can be estimated which to determine the casualty status of individuals over time. Although the methodology can be generalized as described above, three different approaches are taken in this phase depending on the type of agent or effect. * One approach is to estimate human response to chemical and radiological agents and nuclear effects. In this approach, the output is a set of composite injury profiles based on the dose/dosage/insults received by individuals. * One approach is to estimate human response to non-contagious biological agents. In this approach, the output consists of the number of individuals who are exposed and ill. * One approach is to estimate human response to contagious biological agents. In this approach, the output is simply the number of people in the population in various cohorts that are removed over time, either as non-infectious medical casualties or as fatalities.</p>
