  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Logistics Command and Control (C2) Coordination Applications enable users to execute Operations Logistics Chain Management (OLCM). OLCM is a joint venture between NATO and nations to collaboratively plan and manage logistic operation to ensure that national, Host Nation and commercial capabilities are employed to optimal effect. It provides for the effective and efficient use of resources to deliver improved support solution. Therefore, OLCM is defined as a capability designed to optimize the collaborative planning and execution of logistics support to the NATO operations, including the prioritization and coordination of the flow of logistic resources and provision of services into, within and out of the NATO Joint Operational Area based on the NATO Commander’s intent. The capability is operation specific, functions in all phases of a NATO operation and can enable the coordination of activities across a network of interacting NATO and national operations logistics chains (OLCs) that are managing logistic resources committed to the specific NATO operation. The Logistics C2 Coordination Applications enable users to improve the logistics effectiveness of NATO Forces in rapidly changing, complex expeditionary environments and to maximize efficiency for supporting nations, NATO agencies and civil actors. The Logistics C2 Coordination Applications will provide the necessary functionality to deliver an advanced operations logistics management capability enabled by improved exchange of relevant information. The extent of the information exchange may be operation specific as agreed by NATO and nations for the specific operation. The Logistics C2 Coordination Applications will support the two fundamental functions at the core of OLCM  collaborative planning and management of theatre logistics operations. Therefore, The Logistics C2 Coordination Applications scope encompasses planning and forces generation, comprehensive data collection and processing, visualization of the information and visibility over logistic requirements, processes and resources, logistic chain management and decision support.</p>
