  <dd class="data-value"><p>Process lessons exist at two levels - performance lessons and results lessons. Performance lessons encompass the procedures and practices used to plan, manage and execute the defence planning process. Results lessons encompass the ‘process ‘ itself and the work effort performed to produce planned results. Lessons learned are opportunities to minimize mistakes and improve performance capabilities. Not only do they serve to avoid repetitive mistakes, they also strengthen capabilities, providing opportunities to innovate and take on more risk. The process review is best executed as a standardized management process, providing the basis for how processes are reviewed and how the review results are used and incorporated. To ensure that all goals can be fully met standardized review practices should incorporate the following parameters  * Review timing and triggers (what types of events will lead to review initiation?). * Review input requirements (what types of events and circumstances will be reviewed considering deliverables, activities, tasks, decisions and related variables?). * Data collection methodologies (how will review inputs be identified, gathered and organized for review purposes?). * Review benchmarks and analysis criteria (forming the basis for ‘lessons ‘ identification). * Lessons learned reporting methodologies (how will identified lessons be produced, documented and incorporated into the organization’s ‘Defence Planning body of knowledge ‘?). ‘Lessons ‘ can present themselves at any point in the process lifecycle and not just as part of formal reviews. Lessons should be immediately noted and documented to be addressed as part of the larger (and more formal) review process.</p>
