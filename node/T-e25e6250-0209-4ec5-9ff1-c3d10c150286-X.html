  <dd class="data-value"><p>Maintain Health Surveillance includes Disease Surveillance, EpiNATO and Force Health monitoring processes. The Force Health Status process is continuous. There is an ongoing background activity to develop and maintain the National Prophylaxis library as a point of reference for operations planning and for assessing the readiness of units assigned to missions and on standby as part of the NRF. As seen in Figure 3, NATO’s Operations Planning Process includes, up to and including Phase 4b at the Strategic Level, the process of Force Generation. As units are assigned to a mission, specific readiness information may be sought from nations into the Operational Unit Prophylaxis database and compared with the nation’s standards in the library to assess medical readiness and as a contribution to the Commander’s risk assessment. The immunization coverage against diseases of the units participating in an operation can further be taken into consideration during Casualty Rate Estimation (CRE). That same data capture and assessment may be carried out for units assigned to the NRF. Extra operation-specific prophylaxis information can be provided by a nation beyond the items found in the reference library for that nation. As the FHSC system gets filled with prophylaxis data, a set of querying, analysis and reporting capabilities will enable the commander and other associated stake holders to gain further insight on the force readiness and incurred risks for the operation from a health perspective. Longer term benefits will be supporting trend analyses, force health protection KPI calculation and gathering lessons learned. These capabilities will be able to be invoked either using text-based forms or from a map view. Also, relevant geo-referenced query results can be pre-configured and exported to the MEDICS layer of the NATO COP tool. Apart from the mainstream processes described above, two other processes are to maintain a BW countermeasures library and a reference information library. The system will enable the willing nations to report on their countermeasures against BW agents. Lastly, all other reference information deemed relevant to FHS such as STANAGS, standards, recommended readings, disease symptoms, diagnosis, treatments, vaccination and medicine information, dosage, side effects, adverse effects, disease surveillance and medical intelligence and the like will be compiled into the FHS Reference Information Library. Only links to the sources will be provided whenever possible and the content otherwise. Finally, an administrative process run by the system administrator will regulate the maintenance of the lookup values, names of operations, regions, countries, diseases, application groups and the like.</p>
