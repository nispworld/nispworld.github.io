  <dd class="data-value"><p>Most Governments seek to contribute to the efforts of the international community in projecting stability and strengthening security outside of their national territory. One of the means to do so is through cooperation and partnerships. Governments develop and maintain a network of partnerships across their region or around the globe. Governments pursue dialogue and practical cooperation with these governmental and non-governmental partners on a wide range of political and security-related issues, from shaping policy to building defence capacity, developing interoperability and managing crises. Successful partnerships require extensive pre-mission preparation, in-mission coordination and post-mission evaluation. Broadly speaking, the Defence Enterprise opens up parts of its processes, procedures and structures to the participation of partners, allowing partners to make concrete contributions through these. In some cases, special programmes may be created to assist and engage partners on their specific needs. There are many forms of International Partnering, the most powerful form is Alliances. Alliances are formal agreements between two or more nations. In national defense, they’re promises that each nation will support the other, particularly during war. Other forms are partnerships which are less formal than alliances, they help build relationships between nations or organizations like militaries. Like alliances, they benefit the members of the partnership, but they can be short-term and don’t involve a treaty.</p>
