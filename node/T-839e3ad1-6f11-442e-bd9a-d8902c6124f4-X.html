  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Decide Process is the initial, most involved, part of the cycle and will take the most staff effort. The effectiveness of staff effort in the Decide Process will probably determine how effective the operational targeting effort will be. Targeting takes place at the same time and in parallel with, operations staff estimates and the intelligence collection effort. It may assist in setting priorities for intelligence collection and effects planning. The different steps of this process are   * Identify Target Types - Target types and categories will depend on the nature of the operation and the range of effects available. Targets will be developed into target lists and further refined through intelligence collection and the need to manage the dynamic nature of the formation/manoeuvre commandersâ€™ operational requirements. * Identify Target Areas - This Process will consider the Area of Operations and identify areas of targeting interest. All dimensions of the battlespace environment should be considered and limitations such as protected areas taken into account. * Establish Target Accuracy Process - The capabilities of available detection systems and effects systems will dictate technical and procedural limits that should be established. It is important to match appropriate ISTAR and effects systems in order to engage targets. * Input to Intelligence Collection Plan - Targeting input to the intelligence collection mechanism aims to provide a focus for the management of detection systems. Input will identify priority targets, how they might be detected and whether target tracking is required. * Establish Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) Criteria - Decisions must be made early in the process as to what can be defined as a successful (or unsuccessful) attack. There should also be decisions concerning the direction of systems to obtain BDA. Only effective BDA can assess that the effects desired by the formation/manouevre commander are being produced. * Develop Attack Guidance Matrix (AGM) - The AGM provides a consolidated, tabulated support tool for operational targeting decisions and is the culmination of the Decide phase of the cycle. The matrix is intended to act, as far as practical, as an executive document allowing rapid engagement decisions to be made during current operations. AGM should be developed for each phase of an operation and for different operations.</p>
