  <dd class="data-value"><p>CIS services express the functionalities that a communication system offers to the user. The concept of service permits the user to avoid having to know or deal with the circumstances or characteristics that are required on how the service is offered. What is important are the capabilities the system can provide for the user. This approach facilitates and simplifies CIS analysis, planning, and design. There are three main types of user communication system services  Communications Services. Communications services are the services the communication systems provide related mainly with the transfer of information directly from user to user by conventional means not related with computer terminals (voice, data, video teleconference applications, configuration management, etc.). Core Services. Core services are tools that provide generic computer information processing functionalities to the user (e.g., directory, file storage, printing, email, web browsing, and web hosting services). Functional Services. Functional services are tools that provide support to a specific staff function, service, or process. For instance, a functional service could be a decision support tool, a planning tool, or any other type of capability required by the staffs. A functional service will, in general, be oriented towards a specific staff function such as intelligence or logistics. The CISSM is a detailed expansion of the IER to reflect a lower level of requirement granularity. It is an expansion of the IER established by the operational command coordinated and compiled among all NATO supported participants units for submission to SHAPE to be approved and passed to NCISG and NCIA for execution. In case it is not supportable an iterative process led by SHAPE J6 will re-define the requirements to existing capabilities, acceptable by the OHQ. If this is not achievable, SHAPE decides.</p>
