  <dd class="data-value"><p>The purpose of the ‘Business Processes ‘ taxonomy layer defines a business process framework for defence enterprises that can be used for providing  * a common language that allows comparing and linking process architectures of different organizations; * a foundation structure for classifying processes into groups of related processes; * a checklist or starting point for identifying candidate processes undertaken within your organization; and * a basis for determining how process ownership can be assigned. At the most basic level, a ‘Defence Enterprise ‘ is composed of. * The Ministry of Defence, also known as Department of Defence, which is that part of the government that is responsible for matters of defence and usually includes all branches of the military. It is typically controlled by a Defence Minister, Minister of Defence, or Secretary of Defense. * The military forces  the professional organisations and units delivering military capability. A Defence Enterprise typically carries out the following four core functions’  * direct defence policy, military operations at the strategic level, as well as direct rules and standards applying to the entire defence enterprise whilst maintaining accountability for defence activity and spending. * operate military forces domestically and abroad; * generate and develop military forces including the acquisition of the equipment, systems and other items needed so that military units are ready for operations; and * enable and allow the Defence Enterprise to work properly by providing supporting services. The Business Processes taxonomy is a means of grouping processes into appropriately related categories it is not a Business Process Architecture that can be adopted 1 1 by an organization. The taxonomy serves as a reference model that provides typical business processes that can be re-used and adapted to design a new business process architecture.</p>
