  <dd class="data-value"><p>The outcomes of defence planning activities can take years to be realized. Defence planning by its very nature is therefore future looking. The definitions of short, medium and long-term, and the associated focus of the generate activity will influence what can be achieved and informs the scope of the problem. In most mature defence and security planning management systems, it is possible to distinguish three planning horizons and their respective processes  * Long-term planning * Mid-term planning, often designated as programming * Short-term planning Long-term defence and security planning strives to foresee future defence and security requirements by analysing trends in the evolution of the security environment, including threats and challenges, the role of alliances and their policies, and security and defence strategies. Additionally, technological trends are also taken into account. On this basis, a future force model is defined. In this process, the main steps of transitioning towards this future force model are defined. Both future force structure and the transition to it need to be realistic and to consider financial, technological, demographic, and other important constraints. Long-term planning usually covers a period of 10 to 15 years. However, some countries choose to look further into the future, 20 to 30 years (NATO &gt;20 years ) The main purpose of the mid-term planning process is to guarantee that the actual security and defence management activities (reorganisation, recruitment, procurement, training, spending, etc.) serve to achieve defence and security policy objectives and build the future force and required security capabilities. The process of mid-term planning, is often referred to as â€œprogramming. The horizon of mid-term planning is usually four to eight years. However, some countries choose to look further into the future (NATO  7-19 years). Short-term planning serves to detail the first years of the mid-term plan, often in capability component plans (plans of recruitment, education, training, procurement, construction, etc., and the respective budget). The horizon of short-term planning is usually up to 5 years (NATO  0-6 years).</p>
