  <dd class="data-value">Operational readiness is “the capability of a unit/formation, ship, weapon system, or equipment to perform the missions or functions for which it is organized or designed.” (see also [[Operational Readiness Evaluation]] in the Generate process area). The broader lens is structural readiness, which is related to the size of the overall force and composition of the force. Structural readiness is concerned chiefly with how ready the defence enterprise is to conduct its mission. The critical aspect in understanding these two sets of readiness is that choosing one over the other is a choice between capabilities available now and capabilities that will be available in the future. Strategists across the defence enterprise must employ readiness assessment methodologies to account for two major questions  “Ready for when?” and “Ready with what?”. Military professionals must define the timeline of when which capabilities must be available for a mission. There are not enough resources to have every unit ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Strategists and must determine what capabilities should reside in the reserves and what should reside on active duty. Reserve forces require time to mobilize. Mobilization activities range across individual and collective training, equipment issue, medical and administrative readiness, and movement of combat platforms and other equipment. These activities can last months. When designing the military force, strategists must make assumptions on how fast political leadership will decide on mobilization and employment, and the timing of strategic warning. When policy makers assume significant time leading into a crisis, a greater percentage of the force can function at lower levels of operational readiness. Combining the assumptions of what type of conflict is most likely, with the expected duration of warning will inform structural decisions on the size and type of the force.</dd>
