  <dd class="data-value"><p>The Support to Humanitarian Assistance (SHA) mission type consists of activities to relieve or reduce human suffering. Humanitarian Assistance (HA) may occur in response to earthquake, flood, famine, or manmade disasters such as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear contamination or pandemic outbreak. They may also be necessary as a consequence of war or the flight from political, religious, or ethnic persecution. HA is conducted to relieve or reduce the results of natural or man-made disasters or endemic conditions that might present a serious threat to life or that can result in great damage to or loss of property. HA is limited in scope and duration and is designed to supplement or complement the efforts of the HN civil authorities or agencies that may have the primary responsibility for providing that assistance. They normally supplement the activities of governmenral authorities, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), and Intergovernmental Organisations (IGOs). Support to Humanitarian Assistance may be conducted at the request of the Host Nation (HN) as part of another operation, such as a Peace Support Operations (PSO) or Counter Insurgency (COIN), or as an independent distinct operation specifically mounted to alleviate human suffering especially where responsible civil actors are unable or unwilling to support a population adequately. NATO military activities may support short-term tasks such as communications restoration, relief supply management, providing emergency medical care, humanitarian demining, and high priority relief supply delivery. They could also take the form of advice and selected training, assessments, and providing manpower and equipment.</p>
