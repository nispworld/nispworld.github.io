  <dd class="data-value"><p>A ‘track ‘ is the representation of a moving object in terms of its position, course, speed and general characteristics. The information comes from external sources. Tracks may be in two forms  Point Tracks and Bearing Tracks. A Point Track may have two or three dimensions with course and speed. Bearing tracks can have only one dimension, an origin and an angle from true north. The Maritime Track Management Application processes only point tracks, not contacts and sensor plots. It uses the term ‘track ‘ for both one-time report for a vessel and continuous on-line reporting of a vessel by a recognised source. For example, AIS track from an AIS source, NIRIS track feed or Nations’ on-line track feeds are all considered as tracks. Similarly, a report received from a Nation using OTH-T GOLD message will also be treated as a track. The contact reports received from a source are used to create a track if it doesn’t exist, follow-on reports will be used to update that track. Tracks can be dropped if no update is received within a specified time period. Tracks can also be deleted by its reporting source. World-wide track management is supported, which means all tracks detected and reported from different regions of the world will be identified uniquely in the system context. Maritime Track Management Application allows the user to create tracks based on the received track data, update them as necessary, manually correlate them if they are not automatically correlated, and delete them as necessary.</p>
